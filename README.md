1. For demographic representation and best visualization, we have creates mappatient.ipynb which contains the data of all the patients.

2. Further we have analysed the data using tableau by creating a dashboard

3. We have then predicted the people who may fall into non-adherence more by using machine learning algorithms and comparing various aspects.

4. The solution of the same is done by creating an app using figma which is an umbrella app for all the needs of the patient.
5. We have also created a website for the same.
